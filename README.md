# StudySync

The Tutor Tracking System helps tutors efficiently manage student visits by allowing them to add, view, search, and update visit records. It's designed with a user-friendly GUI and backed by a robust MySQL database. 

#How It's Made:

##Tech used: 
Java: Core Funcitinality and logic.
Java Swing: GUI development for a clean, UI
MySQL: Database management to store and retrive tutor-student visit records.
JDBC: For database connectivity
Mockito: Unit testing for realiable code

#Development Process:
1) GUI Design: Created forms for inputting ID, name, topic, visit details, update function, search fuction etc.
2) Database Integration: made a database and connected the GUI to the database using JDBC for secure and fast data handling.
3) Testing: Used Mockito to ensure database interactions work correctly and edge cases are handled.
4) Data Handling: We built search and update function to locate specific functions and update them.

#Optimization

Regularly integrated our GUI to add more functionality where rough sketch was done in our javaSwing.java repo and TutorTrackingSystem.java as our final.
Refactored the GUI and SQL quires to improve performance and be more user-friendly.
Streamlied GUI event listeners to handle user inputs efficiently.

#Lessons Learned

Inproved understanding of integrating GUIs with databases using JDBC.
Learned to make databases using mySQL.
Learned to write, maintain, and refactor code effectively using Agile.
Learn and Test system effectively using Mockito.
Gained insights into optimizing SQL queries for real-world scenarios.
